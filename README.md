</ul>

<h3>Professional Certificate - 13 course series</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare for a career in the high-growth field of data engineering. In this program, you’ll learn in-demand skills like Python, SQL, and Databases to get job-ready in less than 5 months.</li>
  <li>Data engineering is building systems to gather data, process and organize raw data into usable information, and manage data. The work data engineers do provides the foundational information that data scientists and business intelligence (BI) analysts use to make recommendations and decisions.</li>
  <li>This program will teach you the foundational data engineering skills employers are seeking for entry level data engineering roles, including Python, one of the most widely used programming languages. You’ll also master SQL, RDBMS, ETL, Data Warehousing, NoSQL, Big Data, and Spark with hands-on labs and projects.</li>
  <li>You’ll learn to use Python programming language and Linux/UNIX shell scripts to extract, transform and load (ETL) data. You’ll also work with Relational Databases (RDBMS) and query data using SQL statements and use NoSQL databases as well as unstructured data. </li>
  <li>When you complete the full program, you’ll have a portfolio of projects and a Professional Certificate from IBM to showcase your expertise. You’ll also earn an IBM Digital badge and will gain access to career resources to help you in your job search, including mock interviews and resume support.</li>
